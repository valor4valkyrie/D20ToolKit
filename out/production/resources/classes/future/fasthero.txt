The Fast hero uses her Dexterity score to her best advantage. Taking a level in this class demonstrates training in hand-eye coordination, agility, and reflexes. Better defenses, a good attack progression, and a natural aptitude in athletics that require speed and grace combine to define the Fast hero. A Fast hero might be literally quick on her feet, or she might simply move with a catlike grace. She might possess uncanny coordination and amazing reflexes. She uses her natural inclination toward Dexterity-based endeavors to make her way in the world.

Dexterity is the ability associated with this class. Fast heroes often find it advantageous to place good scores in Charisma, Wisdom, and Intelligence.

Athletes who employ speed and grace instead of raw power, stunt people, pilots, professional drivers, law enforcement or military professionals who concentrate on using ranged weapons, and agents-on either side of the law-who employ stealth and sleight of hand are just some of the professional choices available to the Fast hero.
