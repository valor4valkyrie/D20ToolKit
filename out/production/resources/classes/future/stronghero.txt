The Strong hero uses his Strength score to his best advantage. Taking a level in this class demonstrates physical training for overall strength and power. Strong heroes excel at hand-to-hand and melee combat, as well as at other activities that best utilize physical power. A Strong hero might be a bodybuilder or an athlete who concentrates on the power aspect of sports. He might be quietly intimidating or robustly boisterous. He might be as gentle as he is big or a lout and a bully.

Strength is the ability associated with this class. Strong heroes usually also have good scores in Constitution, Dexterity, and at least one of the nonphysical abilities.

Boxers, martial artists, some types of soldiers, athletes who depend on raw physical power, blue-collar workers, and others who rely on pure brawn all fall within the scope of the Strong hero.
