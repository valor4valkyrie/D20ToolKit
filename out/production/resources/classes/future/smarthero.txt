The Smart hero uses his Intelligence score to his best advantage. Taking a level in this class demonstrates educational training in an academic or technical subject. Learning and reasoning powers combine to define the Smart hero. A Smart hero might be brainy or bookish. He might possess uncanny reasoning skills or the ability to puzzle his way out of any situation. Heâ€™s bright, quick-witted, and possessed of a great deal of knowledge-or at least the abilityt o gather that knowledge if he so chooses.

Intelligence is the ability associated with this class. Smart heroes often put a good score into one of their physical abilities (such as Dexterity), and sometimes combine a high Intelligence with either a good Wisdom or Charisma score.

Scientists and researchers of all descriptions, academics, law enforcement or military professionals who specialize in using tactics, deduction, or reason, and many kinds of white-collar professionals fall within the scope of the Smart hero.
