The first step to creating a character is determining what type of character you wish to make. Role-playing games have you assume the role of a character and like most people, we want the character to be strong, fast, smart and tough. However, like in real life, you can't have it all. However, you can excel in one area or another, maybe even two areas. Choosing your class gives you the specialization in one specific role. Want to be smarter than the average bear, choose a smart hero. Want to be fast and agile character that can dodge arrows, maybe even bullets, choose a fast hero.

Hover over the classes below for a better description. Click on one class that sound interesting to you. You can always click the 'Back' on the next screen if you change your mind.
