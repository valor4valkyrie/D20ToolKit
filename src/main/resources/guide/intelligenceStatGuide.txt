Intelligence (Int)
Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. Intelligence is important for any character who skills, and it is the ability

You apply your Intelligence modifier to:
* The number of skill points gained at each new level (though an Intelligence penalty can never reduce this below 1; your character always gets at least 1 skill point per level).
* Search and Knowledge checks, and other skill checks for which Intelligence is the key ability.
