Strength (Str)
Strength measures muscle and physical power. This ability is important for those who engage in hand-to-hand (or “melee”) combat. Strength also sets the maximum amount of weight your character can carry. A character with a Strength score of 0 is too weak to move in any way and is unconscious. Some creatures do not possess a Strength score and have no modifier at all to Strength-based skills or checks.

You apply your character’s Strength modifier to:
* Melee attack rolls.
* Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon, including a sling.
    (Exceptions: Off-hand attacks receive only half the character’s Strength bonus, while two-handed attacks receive 1–1/2 times the Strength bonus.
    A Strength penalty, but not a bonus, applies to attacks made with a bow that is not a composite bow.)
* Climb and Swim checks.
* Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like).
