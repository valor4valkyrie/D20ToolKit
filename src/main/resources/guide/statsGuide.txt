We have rolled some ability scores for you! These are not YOUR stats but we thought we would explain what these are. These stats make up your characters natural basic abilities.

We roll four six-sided dice, re-rolling any results of a '1' and take the three highest. That puts your ability scores between 6 and 18.

A 10 on any ability score is average human ability. A character with an ability score of 6 is a character that has a severe deficiency in that ability while a character with an ability score of 18 is at the peak of human ability.

For example, a character who is strong (ie. a high Strength score) will naturally be better at swimming and climbing. Also, these abilities tie into other factors like attacking with a hand weapon or the amount of weight they can carry or lift.

A character's 'class' will also determine what ability score is important to your character. A strong hero values strength above all other abilities because it ties greatly with the characters natural skills and abilities.

These basic abilities define what your character is naturally good at. This is the first step to making any character.

These ability scores defines the 'Ability Modifier' that will add to other portions of your character, this can be good or bad because the 'Ablilty Modifier' can either be positive or negative number.
