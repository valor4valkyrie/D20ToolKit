We have rolled some ability scores for you! These are not YOUR stats but I thought I would explain what these are. We roll four six sided dice, re-rolling any results of a one and take the three highest. That puts your ability scores between six and eighteen.
These stats make up your characters natural basic abilities. A ten on any ability score is average human ability. That said, a character with an ability score of six is a character that has a severe deficiency in that ability so a character with an ability score of eighteen is at the peak of human ability. These basic abilities define what your character is naturally good at. This is the first step to making any character. These ability scores defines the 'Ability Modifier' that will add to other portions of your character, this can be good or bad because the 'Ablilty Modifier' can either be positive or negative number.
For example, a character who is strong (ie. a high Strength score) will naturally be better at swimming and climbing. Also, these abilities tie into other factors like attack and defense. A strong character will also be better at wielding a melee weapon. A character's 'class' will also determine what ability score is important to your character. A strong hero values strength above all other abilities because it ties heaviliy with his character.1
