Dexterity (Dex)
Measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is important for characters who want to be good shots with ranged weapons or who want to sneak fairly well.

You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:
* Ranged attack rolls
* Defense, provided the character can react to the attack.
* Reflex saving throws, for avoiding grenades and similar attacks.
* Move Silently, Hide, and Drive checks, and other skill checks for which Dexterity is the key ability.
