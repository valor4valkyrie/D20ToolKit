The Tough hero uses his Constitution score to best advantage. Taking a level in this class provides improved health and physical stamina. Better hit points, good fortitude, and the ability t o shrug off some amount of damage combine to define the Tough hero. A Tough hero might be built like a truck or possess a great amount of endurance. He can take a lot of physical punishment, rarely gets sick, and often is hard t o move. A Tough hero can be stubborn or single-minded, feels protective of others, and usually succeeds because he stays in the contest long after the competition has crumbled. He is often stead-fast and confident to a fault.

Constitution is the ability associated with this class. The Tough hero often places good scores in Strength or Dexterity, Wisdom, and Intelligence.

Stunt persons, bodyguards, enforcers, wrestlers, and athletes who demand extreme staying power or who must withstand a lot of physical punishment all fall within the purview of the Tough hero.
